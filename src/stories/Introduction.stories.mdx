# ShapeShift Design Guide

We use [**Chakra Ui**](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started) to help with creating ui quicker and create a consistent theme through out it.

Even though Chakra has documentation around their components. We use storybook to make sure that we have documented the variants and changes that we have modified on top of Chakra to create ShapeShift's Ui.

Here is a link to our [**code standards documentation**](https://github.com/shapeshift/web#helpful-docs)
